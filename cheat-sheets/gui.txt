?# GUI

X11 (X Window System) ## An older, established display server protocol that provides the basic framework for a GUI environment on Unix-like operating systems. It handles window management, graphics rendering, and input device handling.
X Server ##  Manages display, keyboard, and mouse.
X Client ##  Applications that request rendering and input handling from the X Server.
Window Manager ##  Controls the placement and appearance of windows (e.g., GNOME, KDE).

Wayland ## A newer display server protocol designed to replace X11, offering a simpler, more modern approach. It aims to be more efficient and secure by handling tasks that X11 delegates to the window manager and compositor.
Wayland Compositor ## Combines the roles of the X Server and window manager (e.g., Weston, Mutter for GNOME, KWin for KDE).

$XDG_SESSION_TYPE ## variable indicating usage of x11 or wayland
